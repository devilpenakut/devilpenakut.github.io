Si&nbsp;[Joe Belfiore](http://blogs.windows.com/members/Joe-Belfiore/default.aspx)&nbsp;kemarin nulis update tentang Windows Phone dan Windows 8. Ini beberapa quote yang di kemukakan:

## Tentang Windows Phone

> Recognized as the fastest growing OS with 91% year-over-year growth in 2013
> 
> More than 10% share across Europe—which is more than double compared with last year.
> 
> we’ve seen high customer satisfaction data
> 
> Reached critical mass in the Windows Phone Store (now over 240,000 apps) and are still growing – fast – with an average of 500 apps added each day. We’ve had key additions such as Instagram, Vine, Waze and Mint—and today, we announced Facebook Messenger will be available in the coming weeks
> 
> Today in Barcelona we announced we’re now working with&nbsp;**nine new Windows Phone partners, including: Foxconn, Gionee, JSR, Karbonn, Lava (Xolo), Lenovo,LG, Longcheer and ZTE**
> 
> We are adding support for&nbsp; **Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 and 400 series chipsets** , with options that support all major cellular technologies, including **&nbsp;** LTE (TDD/FDD), HSPA+, EVDO and TD-SCMA. We will also support&nbsp; **soft keys** &nbsp;and&nbsp; **dual SIM** where our partners want it for their devices
> 
> To streamline the process of building a Windows Phone device,&nbsp; **today we launched the&nbsp;** [**Windows Hardware Partner Portal**](http://oem.windowsphone.com/)&nbsp;so that all our hardware partners will have direct access to the tools and content needed to build and market their Windows Phone devices efficiently and cost-effectively

## Tentang Windows 8

> We’ll enable our partners to&nbsp; **build lower cost hardware** &nbsp;for a great Windows experience at highly competitive price points
> 
> We are making improvements to the user interface that will naturally bridge touch and desktop
> 
> We are&nbsp; **enhancing support for enterprise customers** &nbsp;via a few tweaks, particularly including features that greatly improve IE8 compatibility in Internet Explorer 11, which is especially critical for web-based line of business applications

Microsoft sepertinya benar-benar berusaha Windows Phone nya bisa diterima, sedang untuk Windows mengobati kekecewaan yang terlalu touch pada versi awal sehingga sekarang untuk desktop pun diperhatikan. Tidak ada kata terlambat, termasuk untuk memasukkan app android buat jalan di WP yang rumornya sedang diusahakan Microsoft sambil memberikan jalan Nokia untuk mengeluarkan Nokia X ber-android.
